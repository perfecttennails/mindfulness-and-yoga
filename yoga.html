      <h1> Vinyasa Yoga</h1>
     <div class="container">
  
    <p>Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga students are expected to memorize a sequence and to practice in the same room as others without being led by the teacher. The role of the teacher is to guide as well as provide adjustments or assist in postures. In other locations, led classes are taught twice per week in place of Mysore style classes, and the teacher will lead a group through the same series at the same time. The led classes were only introduced in K. Pattabhi Jois's senior years.</p>

<h2>Sequences and series</h2>

<p>Advanced (A) Series
Usually an Ashtanga Vinyasa practice of asanas begin with five repetitions of Surya Namaskara A and five repetitions of Surya Namaskara B, followed by a standing sequence. Following this the practitioner progresses through one of six series, followed by a standard closing sequence.</p>

<h3>The six series are:</h3>

<p>The Primary series: Yoga Chikitsa, Yoga for Health or Yoga Therapy
  
The Intermediate series: Nadi Shodhana, The Nerve Purifier (also called the Second series)
  
The Advanced series: Sthira Bhaga, Centering of Strength</p>
  
<li>Advanced A, or Third series</li>
<li>Advanced B, or Fourth series</li>
<li>Advanced C, or Fifth series</li>
<li>Advanced D, or Sixth series</li>
  
<p>There were originally four series on the Ashtanga Vinyasa syllabus: Primary, Intermediate, Advanced A, and Advanced B. A fifth series of sorts was the "Rishi series", which Pattabhi Jois said could be done once a practitioner had "mastered" these four.</p></span>
